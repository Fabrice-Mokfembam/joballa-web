# Verified API integration (v2)

Last smoke run: **2026-06-04** via `npm run smoke:v2` against `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Use the **FRONTEND_*.md** files in this folder as the contracts the frontend should implement against.

## Base URL and auth

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Local API | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) |
| Path prefix | **No** `/api` prefix on worker/employer v2 routes |
| Auth header | `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` |
| Token source | `POST /auth/login` or `POST /auth/verify` → `accessToken` |
| Session bootstrap | `GET /auth/me` → `{ user: AuthSessionUser }` |
| Refresh | `POST /auth/refresh` with `{ refreshToken }` and/or refresh cookie |

## Route map (verified)

### Auth (`FRONTEND_AUTH_ROUTES.md`)

| Method | Path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/auth/register` | Requires `JOBALLA_DEV_FIXED_OTP` in backend `.env` for local OTP |
| POST | `/auth/verify` | Same as above |
| POST | `/auth/resend-otp` | Same as above |
| POST | `/auth/login` | OK |
| GET | `/auth/me` | OK |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | OK |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | OK |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | OK (always returns generic message) |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | Not exercised in smoke (needs OTP) |

Login/register body uses `preferredLanguage`: `"eng"` \| `"fre"` (not `languagePreference`).

**Verify body is only** `{ identifier, code }` (or `otp` instead of `code`), optional `purpose: "registration"`. Never resend `role`, `password`, or `preferredLanguage` on `POST /auth/verify` — that causes `400`. Use lowercase `registration` / `password_reset` for `purpose` (not `REGISTRATION`).

**Not implemented (intentionally removed from v2):**

- `/employer/workforce/:workerId/shifts` (shifts out of scope)

## Paginated list shape

All list endpoints return:

```ts
{ data: T[]; page: number; limit: number; total: number; totalPages: number }
```

Do **not** expect legacy `items` / `totalCount` fields from `/api/worker` or `/api/employer`.

## Running smoke tests locally

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run smoke:v2
```

Optional: set `JOBALLA_DEV_FIXED_OTP=123456` in `.env` to also smoke register/verify/resend-otp.

Scripts live under `scripts/v2-routes/`.
