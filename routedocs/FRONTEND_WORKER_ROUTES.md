# FRONTEND WORKER ROUTES

This document is for the frontend team. It describes Worker portal pages, what each page does, which backend endpoint it calls, what it sends, and what it receives.

**Verified against the running API** — see `VERIFIED_API_INTEGRATION.md`. Worker routes use `/worker/*` (not `/api/worker/*`). Lists use `{ data, page, limit, total, totalPages }`.

**Implementation status** — see `ROUTE_AUDIT.md`. The Next.js app calls `/worker/*` (v2, no `/api` prefix). `/worker/my-jobs` may still use owned-jobs routes vs informal-requests (see audit).

All Worker API calls require a Bearer access token and the authenticated user must have role `worker`.

## Shared Worker Types

```ts
type Paginated<T> = {
  data: T[];
  page: number;
  limit: number;
  total: number;
  totalPages: number;
};

  title: string;
  department: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    slug: string;
    category: string;
  } | null;

  ownerVerified: boolean;
  city: string;
  region?: string | null;
  country: string;
  employmentType: "full_time" | "part_time" | "contract" | "casual" | "seasonal" | "internship";
  workMode: "onsite" | "remote" | "hybrid";
